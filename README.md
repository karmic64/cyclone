# cyclone

This is a test ROM I used to verify the extended Mega Drive emulated by the Sega Genesis Flashback console. See [the dedicated page](https://karmic128.neocities.org/sgflashback) for more information.

You need [vasm](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm) (m68k CPU, mot syntax) to assemble it. See [here](https://www.instructables.com/Adding-Games-to-Atgames-Genesis-Flashback-HD) for a guide on how to put the ROM on your Flashback.

By the way, please excuse the name. I saw the string "Cyclone" a lot in the Flashback files and thought it was the emulator's internal name, but it's just the name of the [68k emulator](https://notaz.gp2x.de/cyclone.php) it uses. It's a cool name though, right?
